# App Ideas

Don't build apps.

You'll stay poor.

Do this instead:

1. Find a transformation people want
2. Build an app that guides them
3. Ask for money in return

Some transformations people want:

- save $100/m
- earn $10K/m
- find a soulmate
- lose 10kg / 20lb
- spiritual awakening

Start with transformation.

Not an app.

And you'll be rich.


"How do you know if there's a market for a new app?"
"How do you validate the value of an app?"
"How fast can you launch a new app?"

The short version is: validate fast :)

The long version?

1. Market validation → Check if people want the app
2. Value validation → Ensure we can solve a real problem
3. Fast release → Launch within two weeks
4. Focus → Make one feature really good
5. Simplicity → Keep everything else simple


## Make $100,000 with this app idea.

I call it the Synthesizer App (3 steps):

1. Pick a Problem
   ↳ Something you solved for yourself
   ↳ Losing weight, playing drums...

2. Create Lessons
   ↳ Bite-sized lessons to follow
   ↳ Could be audio, video, text

3. Charge Money
   ↳ Monthly subscription to unlock
   ↳ Push new content every month

That's how I made my first $100K with apps.
