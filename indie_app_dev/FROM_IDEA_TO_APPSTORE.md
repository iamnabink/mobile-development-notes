From Idea to App Store in 7 Days

After listening to ðŸš€ Antoine van der Lee's podcast with Jordi Bruin where they discussed the 2-2-2 development approach (2 hours validate, 2 days prototype, 2 weeks release), I challenged myself to release 5 apps before Christmas since I have some free time on my hands. This is app No1, inspired by a word association game I saw on Netflix's "Devil's Plan."

~ Tech Implementation ~
ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
â€¢ SwiftUI, MVVM, Clean Architecture
â€¢ Firebase (Auth, Crashlytics, Firestore, Remote Config)
â€¢ RevenueCat for IAPs, Mixpanel for analytics
â€¢ Swinject for DI

ðŸ¤– Development Tools:
â€¢ Primary: Cursor AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) + SweetPad extension
â€¢ Secondary: Xcode (Copilot GPT 4o)
â€¢ CI/CD: Xcode Cloud
â€¢ Design Assets: Midjourney, App LaunchPad

~ The AI Experience ~
I feel like mobile devs, especially iOS, are lagging in AI adoption in their day-to-day programming as we are stuck with Xcode (sorry Apple, but Xcode autocomplete needs more work). I went all-in with AI as a core part of my workflow.

~ What Worked ~
â€¢ Prototype built in 10 minutes
â€¢ UI component generation and gameplay logic
â€¢ Quick solutions for common problems
â€¢ Complex logic implementation with clear instructions
â€¢ Automated monotonous tasks (new screen creation, analytics events)
â€¢ Mocks and unit test generation
â€¢ Refactoring its own code (e.g., breaking large SwiftUI views into components)
â€¢ Context-aware code suggestions and adaptation to coding style
â€¢ Level generation and validation
â€¢ Auto-prediction of code before typing (one of Cursor's killer features)
â€¢ Occasionally brilliant, unexpected solutions

~ Challenges & Learnings ~
â€¢ AI excels at implementation but needs clear architectural guidance, otherwise defaulting to the simplest solution
â€¢ Code quality varies, requires strict human refinement
â€¢ Complex bugs still need human problem-solving
â€¢ AI assists but doesn't replace development skills
â€¢ It needs strict guidance from an engineer for production-ready code. I spent many hours polishing the implementation and making it production-ready without any AI.
â€¢ About 50/50 AI/human code ratio in the end.

~ Results ~
â€¢ Clean, minimalist word association game
â€¢ Production-ready in 7 days
â€¢ Scalable architecture for future updates

~ Key Takeaways ~
â€¢ AI transforms workflow but doesn't replace developers
â€¢ Perfect for indie, side projects, prototyping and MVPs
â€¢ Reduces boring monotonous part of coding
â€¢ iOS developers need better AI tools

~ What's Next? ~
This is the first of five apps I plan to build by year's end. Looking forward to sharing more insights as this journey continues, stay tuned.
