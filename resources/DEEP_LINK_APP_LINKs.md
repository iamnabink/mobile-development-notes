Deep link vs App Link

## URL Schemes vs Universal Links for iOS Deep Linking

URL schemes and Universal Links are two ways to implement deep linking in iOS apps, allowing users to open an app directly from a link and navigate to specific content within the app. Here's a comparison of the two approaches:

### URL Schemes
- Easy to implement by adding a URL scheme in the app's metadata[1]
- Allows defining custom URL schemes like "myapp://profile" to open the app and navigate to a specific screen[1]
- If the app is not installed, the link will open in Safari, leading to a blank page[1]
- No fallback webpage if the app is not installed[1]

### Universal Links
- More complex to set up, requiring a JSON file on the website's server to verify app ownership[1]
- Uses the website's URL (e.g., "www.myapp.com") to open the app directly if installed, or fall back to the website if not[1]
- Allows defining specific paths to open the app at different screens, like "www.myapp.com/profile"[1]
- Provides a fallback webpage if the app is not installed, improving user experience[1]
- Requires enabling Associated Domains capability in Xcode and adding the website's domain[1]

In summary, URL schemes are easier to implement but lack fallback options, while Universal Links provide a more seamless experience by opening the app if installed or falling back to the website, but require more setup. The choice depends on the specific needs of the app and the desired user experience.
