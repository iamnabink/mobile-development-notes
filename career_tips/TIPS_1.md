1. The Permission Pattern
   ↳ You're letting others set the pace of your career.
   ↳ Practice the "24-hour rule".

2. Mistaking Busy for Productive
   ↳ You confuse movement with progress.
   ↳ Start each week by identifying "One Big Move".

3. The Competence Curse
   ↳ Your expertise in low-value tasks is trapping you.
   ↳ Mark tasks that don't align with your career.

4. The Documentation Obsession
   ↳ You're protecting yourself instead of progressing.
   ↳ Spend more time on visible, impactful work.

5. The Responsibility Without Authority Trap
   ↳ You're accountable for outcomes you can't control.
   ↳ Clearly define your decision-making authority.

6. The Expertise Hoarding
   ↳ You're keeping knowledge to yourself.
   ↳ Teach someone one aspect of your job every week.

7. The Future Fraud
   ↳ You're preparing for roles you'll never want.
   ↳ Write your ideal five years from now.

These habits are pretty innocent on the face of it.
In reality, they can seriously harm your career growth.
