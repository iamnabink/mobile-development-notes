Part 1: Preparing for Release
In this first part, you’ll learn about:
* App Icons and Splash Screens
* Multiple Flavors and Environments
* Error Monitoring
* Analytics
* Force Upgrade Strategies
* Collecting user feedback and in-app reviews
* Creating a website for your app
  These things take time, but they are crucial for a successful app launch. And with my guidance, you’ll breeze through them.
  Part 2: Release Management and Automation
  With preparations complete, it’s time to launch.
  But submitting your app to the stores involves a lot of red tape. So, all the important steps will be covered in detail (both for testing and distribution):
* Manual Android release: build, code sign, upload, and submit your Android app to the Google Play Store
* Manual iOS release: build, code sign, upload, and submit your iOS app to App Store Connect
  Manual releases take a lot of time, so you’ll want to automate the whole process:
* App Release Automation with Codemagic and GitHub Actions
* Going further with Fastlane
  By this stage, you’ll have the tools and knowledge to manage and automate your app releases, making them seamless and scalable.
  Part 3: Post-Release Techniques
  Your app is live — what's next? Enhance and improve your process even further:
* Automatic screenshots generation
* Feature Flags
* A/B testing
* Code push
